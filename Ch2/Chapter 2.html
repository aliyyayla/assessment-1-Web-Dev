<!--CHAPTER 2 ONE PAGE WEBSITE 
Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.
Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
At least two classes.
One link styled as a button.

            <li> CHAN METHA</li>
            <ul>
                <li> I should say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought, of course, it's another brilliant movie because 
                    it has Meryl Streep in it who defines the standards of 'acting'. But i stand corrected. It's not just 
                    Meryl Streep who invents a new combination of smug and swag as an upper-classed fashionista boss but it's both 
                    her young PAs. Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway who have shown a lot of potential in elegantly sticking up to their 
                    roles and has mimicked the lifestyle of a hard-working underrated desprate personal assistant who awfully ends up to
                    be a great disappointment to her boss against all her efforts. It's so subtle an acting style. Anne Hathaway on the 
                    other hand has shown a character arc of transitioning from a regular girl to being a swayed by a swirl of complex
                    characters and persons that work with her and she has to put up with them in order to stay in the job.
                    She goes an extra mile always and gets to decide what's best for her life. The other characters in the movie are 
                    well cast too. But Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway just stand out. If you're a connoisseur of fine arts
                    and drama, you should definetly watch it for the over the top performances.

                <li> Woww!! WHat an eye opener movie. I didn't know about harsh-but-true things related to fashion industry. It makes
                    you think we worry about small and petty things like clothes, fashion sense, shoes, jacket we wear etc. and we try
                    to emulate the models and celebrities who endorse these brands. But decision depends person-to-person and it's opene ended.
                    <br>
                    Now coming to the film, it is about Andy(Hathaway) who is looking for a job of a journalist but ends us as an assistant
                    to Miranda(Streep) for the time being, how she starts liking and admiring fashion(earlier she didn't), what events lead to
                    quit her job and finally became journalist in one of the press.<br>
                    Good story and gives a feel a good message in acting: MERYL STREEP. The name is enough :p
                    <br>
                    My favourite Scene:<br>
                    Last dialouge
                    Meryl Streep: "Don't be ridiculous, everyone wants to be like me". Then after that Hathaway was speechless and her wits' end
                    (same as I) and just walked away.It left a hidden message no matter what we end up doing we don't want just to please people and
                    it is our choice wether we want to do it or not.

            <ul>
                <li> Every role in this movie is well portrayed and there is so much going on with this movie. Gives you so many perspectives of life,
                    your fight for your love, career, the opportunity costs, hard and ruthless decisions you need make to climb up and stay there, how this 
                    mad race can drive you to be the best or can even make you forget your core. And all of this presented in a highly entertaining way. Subtly
                    presents the idea that life is ultimately the set of choices you make for yourself, where in you get to define the path you take, 
                    what matters to you and what you value. Watched it multiple times and yet never get bored of watching it for one more time. Meryl Streep, 
                    Huge respect.. :) Anne, Emily and Stanely <3>
